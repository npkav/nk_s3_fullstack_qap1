Howdy! This is a simple password generator utilizing Node.js CLI flags that I am creating for my Full Stack JavaScript QAP 1.

This README will be updated as I continue to work on this project with instructions on how to use the password generator
as well as archiving my plaintext changelog.

--------------------------------

## How to Use

To run the password generator, navigate to /nk_s3_fullstack_qap1/ in the terminal and run the following command:
```
node passgen.js
``` 

Alternatively, you can run the following command via node:
```
passgen
```
